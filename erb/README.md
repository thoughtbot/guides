# ERB

[Sample](sample.html.erb)

- When wrapping long lines, keep the method name on the same line as the ERB
  interpolation operator and keep each method argument on its own line.
- Use a trailing comma after each argument in a multi-line method call,
  including the last item.
- Prefer double quotes for attributes.
