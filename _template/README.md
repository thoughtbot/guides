In this section (or as many sections as you need) convey the best practices
around the topic of the guide.

This typically takes one of three forms:

1. A section or sections with lists of specific
   [guidelines](/README.md#a-note-on-the-language)
2. Primarily textual sections
3. A combination of both

## How to...

This section, if applicable, should index a list of "How-to" guides for this
guide's topic. These should be stored relative to this `README.md` file in a
folder named `how-to`.

- [Do something](./how-to/do-something.md)
- [Do something else](./how-to/do-something-else.md)
