# Template

In a sentence or two, describe what this guide is about. A guide can be about a programming language or framework, a
design or development tool, or an entirely non-technical topic.

## Best Practices

In this section (or as many sections as you need) convey the best practices around the topic of the guide.

This typically takes one of three forms:

1. A section or sections with lists of specific [guidelines](/README.md#a-note-on-the-language)
2. Primarily textual sections
3. A combination of both

## How to...

This section, if applicable, should index a list of "How-to" guides for this guide's topic. These should be stored
relative to this `README.md` file in a folder named `how-to`.

Here are some examples:

- [Do something](./how-to/do-something.md)
- [Do something else](./how-to/do-something-else.md)
