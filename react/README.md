# React

- Use React in [Strict Mode]
- Use React with [TypeScript](/typescript/)
- Avoid nested routing if using [React Router]
- Prefer [Function Components] over [Class Components]
- Prefer keeping a single component in each file
- Use `PascalCase` for component names and their file names
- Use [React Hooks]
- Use pre-built hooks when possible (e.g. [streamich/react-use])
- Use [custom hooks] to encapsulate stateful logic outside a component
- Avoid nesting [Forward Refs]
- Avoid [Higher-Order Components] and [recompose] (see hooks above as an
  alternative)
- Prefer the `children` prop over [render props]
- Prefer using [TypeScript prop interfaces] over [PropTypes]
- Prefer the [short syntax] when using [Fragments]
- Prefer [React Contexts] over [Redux]
- Avoid using indexes as the value for [keys]
- Prefer [component composition over component inheritance]

## General Philosophies

- For greenfield React projects we like to use [TypeScript]. TypeScript is a
  typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. For a quick
  introduction, check out [TypeScript in 5 minutes].
- If our app needs to make network requests and hold state outside of a
  component, we like using GraphQL and our preferred library is [Apollo]. We
  have a [section on `GraphQL`](/graphql) in our Guides.
- When building React apps with TypeScript and Apollo, we've found working in
  [VSCode] to be a mostly-good experience.
