# Protecting Personal or Identifying Information

Data privacy and security should be made a priority when developing software in
an effort to protect personal or identifying information.

Data privacy and security is important for everyone. It is especially vital for individuals who, due to their backgrounds or circumstances, might be at a higher risk of harmful consequences from privacy violations.

Examples include:

- Survivors of domestic abuse or those who are trying to escape domestic abuse
- LGBTQIA+ individuals who might be in an unsafe circumstance in relation to their identity, including if their housing is dependent on someone who might evict them because of it
- Political dissidents, asylum seekers, targets of government-sanctioned
  violence
- Undocumented immigrants
