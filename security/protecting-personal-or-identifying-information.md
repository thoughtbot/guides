# Protecting Personal or Identifying Information

Data privacy and security should be made a priority when developing software in
an effort to protect personal or identifying information.

Some individuals, due to their backgrounds or circumstances, might be at a
higher risk of harmful consequences from privacy violations.

Examples include:

- Survivors of domestic abuse or those who are trying to escape domestic abuse
- LGBTQIA+ individuals, especially if their housing is dependent on someone who
  might evict them upon learning this, or if they're in a number of other unsafe
circumstances
- Political dissidents, asylum seekers, targets of government-sanctioned
  violence.
- Undocumented immigrants.
