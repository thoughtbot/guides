# Objective-C

[Sample](sample.m)

- Setup new projects using [Liftoff] and follow provided directory structure.
- Prefer categories on `Foundation` classes to helper methods.
- Prefer string constants to literals when providing keys or key paths to
  methods.
- Place `#import`s into the prefix header (`ProjectName-Prefix.pch`) only if
  used in _many_ files.
- Place `.xib` files under `Resources/Nibs` and their associated view files in
  `Classes/Views`.
- Order `#import` statements alphabetically.
- Order `@class` directives alphabetically.
- Order `@property` modifiers: memory management, atomicity, writability.
- Leave out `@property` modifiers unless needed, `nonatomic` is the only one
  needed in most cases.
- Prefer strong IBOutlet references.
- Prefer `@class` to `#import` when referring to external classes in a public
  `@interface`.
- Prefer `@property` to declaring instance variables.
- Prefix class names with a 2 or 3 letter project acronym.
- Prefix string constants being used as keys with 'k'.
- Remove `#import` statements for `Foundation` and `UIKit` in new project
  templates.
- Separate methods by function using `#pragma mark - <Section Name>`
- Separate sections into subsections using `#pragma mark <Subsection Name>`
- Use `@[arrayObject]`, `@{@"key" : value}`, `@(YES or NO)`, and `@5.0`
  literals.
- Use `@interface ClassName ()` to declare private properties.
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for method names.
- Use `NSAssert` in methods that require the presence of certain arguments.
- Write methods using the happy path. Indent the exceptional cases. Keep the
  optimal case in the left-most column.
- Prefer `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:` when looping through arrays.
- Always use braces with control and loop blocks unless it can easily fit on one
  line.
- Place opening brace for control and loop blocks on same line.
- Prefer `NSInteger`, `CGFloat`, and similar macros over `int`, `float`, and
  other base types.
- Prefer _Auto Layout_ for view layouts and constraints.
