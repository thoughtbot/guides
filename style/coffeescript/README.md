CoffeeScript
============

[Sample](sample.coffee)

* Avoid conditional modifiers (lines that end with conditionals).
* Avoid backticks.
* Initialize arrays using `[]`.
* Initialize empty objects and hashes using `{}`.
* Prefer `==` and `!=` to `is` and `isnt`
* Prefer `||` and `&&` to `or` and `and`
* Prefer `!` over `not`
* Prefer `@` over `this` for referencing instance properties.
* Prefer double quotes.
* Use hyphen-separated filenames, such as `coffee-script.coffee`.
* Use `PascalCase` for classes, `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions,
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants, `_single_leading_underscore` for
  private variables and functions.
* Use zero spaces before and one space after the colon in a colon assignment
  (i.e. classes, objects).
