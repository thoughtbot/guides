Rails
=====

* Avoid `member` and `collection` routes.
* Use private instead of protected when defining controller methods.
* Name date columns with `_on` suffixes.
* Name datetime columns with `_at` suffixes.
* Name time columns (referring to a time of day with no date) with `_time`
  suffixes.
* Name initializers for their gem name.
* Order ActiveRecord associations alphabetically by association type, then
  attribute name. [Example][order-associations].
* Order ActiveRecord validations alphabetically by attribute name.
* Order ActiveRecord associations above ActiveRecord validations.
* Order controller contents: filters, public methods, private methods.
* Order i18n translations alphabetically by key name.
* Order model contents: constants, macros, public methods, private methods.
* Put application-wide partials in the [`app/views/application`] directory.
* Use `def self.method`, not the `scope :method` DSL.
* Use the default `render 'partial'` syntax over `render partial: 'partial'`.
* Use `link_to` for GET requests, and `button_to` for other HTTP verbs.
* If you break up an argument list for a macro,
  keep the first argument on the same line as the macro,
  and break the following arguments onto their own lines.
  [Example 1][multi-line macro 1]
  [Example 2][multi-line macro 2]

Migrations
----------

[Sample](migration.rb)

* Set an empty string as the default constraint for non-required string and text
  fields. [Example][default example].

[default example]: migration.rb#L6

Routes
------

* Avoid the `:except` option in routes.
* Order resourceful routes alphabetically by name.
* Use the `:only` option to explicitly state exposed routes.

Background Jobs
---------------

* Define a `PRIORITY` constant at the top of delayed job classes.
* Define two public methods: `self.enqueue` and `perform`.
* Put delayed job classes in `app/jobs`.

Email
-----

* Use the user's name in the `From` header and email in the `Reply-To` when
  [delivering email on behalf of the app's users].
