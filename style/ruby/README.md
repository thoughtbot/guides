[Sample](sample.rb)

* Avoid conditional modifiers (lines that end with conditionals). [36491dbb9]
* Avoid multiple assignments per line (`one, two = 1, 2`). [#109]
* Avoid organizational comments (`# Validations`). [#63]
* Avoid ternary operators (`boolean ? true : false`). Use multi-line `if`
  instead to emphasize code branches. [36491dbb9]
* Avoid explicit return statements. [#48]
* Avoid using semicolons. [#108]
* Avoid bang (!) method names. Prefer descriptive names. [#122]
* Don't use `self` explicitly anywhere except class methods (`def self.method`)
  and assignments (`self.attribute =`). [#89]
* Prefer nested class and module definitions over the shorthand version
  [Example][class definition example] [#332]
* Prefer `detect` over `find`. [0d819844]
* Prefer `select` over `find_all`. [0d819844]
* Prefer `map` over `collect`. [0d819844]
* Prefer `reduce` over `inject`. [#237]
* Prefer double quotes for strings. [#174]
* Prefer `&&` and `||` over `and` and `or`. [#153]
* Prefer `!` over `not`. [#195]
* Prefer `&:method_name` to `{ |item| item.method_name }` for simple method
  calls. [#183]
* Prefer `if` over `unless`. [#254]
* Use `_` for unused block parameters. [0d819844]
* Prefix unused variables or parameters with underscore (`_`). [#335]
* Use a leading underscore when defining instance variables for memoization.
  [#373]
* Use `%{}` for single-line strings containing double-quotes that require 
  interpolation. [36491dbb9]
* Use `{...}` for single-line blocks. Use `do..end` for multi-line blocks.
  [0d819844]
* Use `?` suffix for predicate methods. [0d819844]
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules, `snake_case` for variables and
  methods, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. [36491dbb9]
* Use `def self.method`, not `def Class.method` or `class << self`. [40090e22]
* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. [36491dbb9]
* Don't use spaces after required keyword arguments. [Example][required kwargs]
  [#205]
* Use `each`, not `for`, for iteration. [36491dbb9]
* Use a trailing comma after each item in a multi-line list, including the last
  item. [Example][trailing comma example] [#167]
* Use heredocs for multi-line strings. [36491dbb9]
* Prefer `private` over `protected` for non-public `attr_reader`s,
  `attr_writer`s, and `attr_accessor`s. [#417], [#190]
* Order class methods above instance methods. [#320]
* Prefer method invocation over instance variables. [#331]
