Formatting
----------

* Avoid inline comments.
* Break long lines after 120 characters.
* Delete trailing whitespace.
* Don't include spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.
* Don't misspell.
* Don't vertically align tokens on consecutive lines.
* If you break up a hash, keep the elements on their own lines and closing curly
  brace on its own line.
* Indent continued lines two spaces.
* Indent private methods equal to public methods.
* If you break up a chain of method invocations, keep each method invocation on
  its own line. Place the `.` at the end of each line, except the last.
  [Example][dot guideline example].
* Use 2 space indentation (no tabs).
* Use an empty line between methods.
* Use empty lines around multi-line blocks.
* Use spaces around operators, except for unary operators, such as `!`.
* Use spaces after commas, after colons and semicolons, around `{` and before
  `}`.
* Use [Unix-style line endings][newline explanation] (`\n`).
* Use [uppercase for SQL key words and lowercase for SQL identifiers].

Naming
------

* Avoid abbreviations.
* Avoid object types in names (`user_array`, `email_method` `CalculatorClass`, `ReportModule`).
* Prefer naming classes after domain concepts rather than patterns they
  implement (e.g. `Guest` vs `NullUser`, `CachedRequest` vs `RequestDecorator`).
* Name the enumeration parameter the singular of the collection.
* Name variables created by a factory after the factory (`user_factory`
  creates `user`).
* Name variables, methods, and classes to reveal intent.
* Treat acronyms as words in names (`XmlHttpRequest` not `XMLHTTPRequest`),
  even if the acronym is the entire name (`class Html` not `class HTML`).
* Suffix variables holding a factory with `_factory` (`user_factory`).

Organization
------------

* Order methods so that caller methods are earlier in the file than the methods
  they call.
* Order methods so that methods are as close as possible to other methods they
  call.
