# Sass

- [Sample](sample.scss)
- [Default stylelint configuration](.stylelintrc.json)
  - This configuration aligns with our team-wide guides below. It does _not_,
    however, enforce a particular class naming structure,
    which is a team decision to be made on a per-project basis.

## Formatting

* Use the SCSS syntax.
* Use hyphens when naming mixins, extends, functions & variables: `span-columns` not `span_columns` or `spanColumns`.
* Use one space between property and value: `width: 20px` not `width:20px`.
* Use a blank line above a selector that has styles.
* Prefer hex color codes `#fff` or `#FFF`.
* Avoid using shorthand properties for only one value: `background-color: #ff0000;`, not `background: #ff0000;`
* Use `//` for comment blocks not `/* */`.
* Use one space between selector and `{`.
* Use double quotation marks.
* Use only lowercase, except for hex or string values.
* Don't add a unit specification after `0` values, unless required by a mixin.
* Use a leading zero in decimal numbers: `0.5` not `.5`
* Use space around operands: `$variable * 1.5`, not `$variable*1.5`
* Avoid in-line operations in shorthand declarations (Ex. `padding: $variable * 1.5 variable * 2`)
* Use parentheses around individual operations in shorthand declarations: `padding: ($variable * 1.5) ($variable * 2);`
* Use double colons for pseudo-elements
* Use a `%` unit for the amount/weight when using Sass's color functions: `darken($color, 20%)`, not `darken($color, 20)`
* Use a trailing comma after each item in a map, including the last item.

## Selectors

* Use meaningful names: `$visual-grid-color` not `$color` or `$vslgrd-clr`.
* Use ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.
* Avoid nesting more than 3 selectors deep.
* Avoid using comma delimited selectors.
* Avoid nesting within a media query.

## Organization

* Use a `base` directory for styling element selectors, global variables, global extends and global mixins.
* Use HTML structure for ordering of selectors. Don't just put styles at the bottom of the Sass file.
* Avoid having files longer than 100 lines.

## General syntax and formatting

### Declarations block ordering

- Order declarations alphabetically.
- Order items within the declaration block in the following order:
    1. Sass at-rules, e.g. `@include`
    1. CSS properties
    1. Media queries
    1. Pseudo-classes
    1. Pseudo-elements
    1. Nested elements

#### Code examples

Alphabetize declarations:

```scss
.class {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Alphabetize prefixed properties as if the prefix doesn't exist:

```scss
.class {
  font-family: system-ui;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-weight: $weight-variable;
}
```

Comprehensive example of ordering items within a declaration block:

```scss
.class {
  @include size(10px);

  display: block;
  margin: $spacing-variable;

  @media (min-width: $screen-variable) {
    padding: $spacing-variable;
  }

  &:focus {
    border-color: $color-variable;
  }

  &::before {
    content: "";
  }

  .nested-element {
    margin: $spacing-variable;
  }
}
```

#### Motivation

Alphabetizing is automatable and is commonly a feature built into
code editors (see Resources below).

#### Linting

Alphabetical declaration ordering can be linted using stylelint with the
[stylelint-order][stylelint-order] plugin and its
`order/properties-alphabetical-order` rule.

#### Resources

- Atom users can use the [Sort Lines package][sort-lines], which provides
  commands and keybindings for alphabetical sorting.
- Sublime Text users can use the `Edit > Sort Lines` menu item, or press
  <kbd>F5</kbd> to sort lines alphabetically.
