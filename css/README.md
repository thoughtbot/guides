# CSS Best Practices

- Document the project's CSS architecture (the README, component library or
  style guide are good places to do this), including things such as:
  - Organization of stylesheet directories and Sass partials
  - Selector naming convention
  - Code linting tools and configuration
  - Browser support
- Use Sass.
- Use [Autoprefixer] to generate vendor prefixes based on the project-specific
  browser support that is needed.
- Prefer `overflow: auto` to `overflow: scroll`, because `scroll` will always
  display scrollbars outside of macOS, even when content fits in the container.
- [Create breakpoints] when the content "breaks," and is awkward or difficult to
  read,
  - Avoid creating breakpoints that target specific devices
  - Prefer `em` units instead of `px` for breakpoint values
  - Start with the smallest viewport size and work upwards using
    `min-width`/`min-height`
- Use [double colon syntax] for pseudo-elements

## Linting

- Use stylelint to lint CSS & Sass
  - We maintain a [sharable stylelint configuration] which enforces our guides
    found in this repo

## Selectors

### Selector specificity

- Don't use ID selectors.
- Avoid over-qualified selectors, e.g. `h1.page-title`.

<details>

#### Code examples

`h1.page-title` carries a specificity of 2, but can be reduced to 1 by removing
the `h1` type selector:

```diff
-h1.page-title
+.page-title {
   // …
 }
```

#### Motivation

Using an ID in a selector increases its specificity, making it more difficult to
work with alongside class selectors. Furthermore, because IDs must be unique
within an HTML document, using them as CSS selectors limits reusability.

#### Resources

- Learn about [how specificity is calculated].

### Selector naming

- Use lowercase characters and hyphens (sometimes referred to as hyphen-case,
  dash-case, or kebab-case) when naming selectors.
- Be consistent about naming conventions. For instance, if a project is using
  BEM, continue using it, and if it's not, don't introduce it.
- Don't uses Sass parent selectors (`&`) to concatenate selector names.

<details>

#### Code examples

Use lowercase characters and hyphens in selector names:

```scss
.class-name {
  // …
}
```

Don't concatenate selector names:

```scss
.class {
  &__child-class {
    // …
  }
}
```

#### Motivation

Concatenating selector names makes it more difficult to search and find
selectors in the codebase.
