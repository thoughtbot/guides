# Working Agreement

A living document for our ever evolving working agreements.

## On Call

- On call responsibility rotates on a weekly basis. 
- The rotation occurs on Monday mornings.
- The individual on call needs to be available by phone during off hours.
- The individual needs to be within a half hour of a machine with internet access so that they are able to diagnose any problems.


## Badger Duty

- Honeybadgers are assigned during Storytime
- Each dev is assigned an HB for the week, and it it's that person's job to resolve it
- If that person gets stuck, they have to find someone willing to pair on it
- If you finish your HB quickly, you can let the team know so that those who are stuck can pair with you.
- If you know who can easily fix the HB, you can pair with that person, but you are still responsible for seeing it through.
- If it takes longer than a week to fix, it is reviewed at the next Storytime.
- It can be turned into a larger project, or reassigned for the week.
- Unless a special case is made, no more than 25% of a dev's time should be spent on HB's
