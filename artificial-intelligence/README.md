This guide exists to save time by showing which AI tools are being used and how, so everyone can learn from collective experience rather than starting from scratch.

AI is evolving quickly, and people at thoughtbot are experimenting with different tools in their work. Instead of everyone spending time evaluating tools on their own, this guide brings together our shared experiences so we can learn from each other and make faster, better-informed choices.

This makes the guide a living resource, updated regularly to reflect how our use of AI is changing. It is not a fixed set of rules, but a practical reference that saves time, helps people get started more quickly, and ensures our decisions are built on collective experience.

Here’s how it works:
	•	Survey and gather input: Once a quarter, we ask everyone what AI tools they are using, how they are using them, and what has or hasn’t worked.
	•	Create a shared guide: The survey responses are collected here to give visibility into what people are actually using. This lets everyone see the range of tools in play, learn from others’ experiences, and decide what they’d like to experiment with themselves.
