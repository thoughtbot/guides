# Sass

- [Sample](sample.scss)
- [Shared stylelint configuration]

  - This configuration aligns with our team-wide guides below. It does _not_,
    however, enforce a particular class naming structure, which is a team
    decision to be made on a per-project basis.

- When using [sass-rails], use the provided [asset-helpers] (e.g. `image-url`
  and `font-url`), so that Rails' Asset Pipeline will re-write the correct paths
  to assets.
- Prefer mixins to `@extend`.
- Use maps and variables to codify and centralize breakpoint values
  - Prefer abstract names such as `small`, `medium`, `large`, etc. instead of
    specific devices
  - Nest breakpoints inside of the relevant selector
  - If a component needs a specific breakpoint to work, keep it with the
    relevant component partial. If other components need the same value,
    integrate it into the centralized breakpoint list

## Formatting

- Use the SCSS syntax.
- Use hyphens when naming mixins, extends, functions & variables: `span-columns`
  not `span_columns` or `spanColumns`.
- Avoid using shorthand properties for only one value: `background-color:
  #ff0000;`, not `background: #ff0000;`
- Use `//` for comment blocks not `/* */`.
- Avoid in-line operations in shorthand declarations (Ex. `padding: $variable *
  1.5 variable * 2`)
- Use parentheses around individual operations in shorthand declarations:
  `padding: ($variable * 1.5) ($variable * 2);`
- Use a `%` unit for the amount/weight when using Sass's color functions:
  `darken($color, 20%)`, not `darken($color, 20)`
- Use a trailing comma after each item in a map, including the last item.

## Selectors

- Use meaningful names: `$visual-grid-color` not `$color` or `$vslgrd-clr`.
- Use ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.
- Avoid nesting more than 3 selectors deep.
- Avoid using comma delimited selectors.
- Avoid nesting within a media query.

## Organization

- Use a `base` directory for styling element selectors, global variables, global
  extends and global mixins.
- Use HTML structure for ordering of selectors. Don't just put styles at the
  bottom of the Sass file.
- Avoid having files longer than 100 lines.

## General syntax and formatting

### Declarations block ordering

- Order declarations alphabetically.
- Order items within the declaration block in the following order:
  1. Sass at-rules, e.g. `@include`
  1. CSS properties
  1. Media queries
  1. Pseudo-classes
  1. Pseudo-elements
  1. Nested elements

#### Code examples

Alphabetize declarations:

```scss
.class {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Alphabetize prefixed properties as if the prefix doesn't exist:

```scss
.class {
  font-family: system-ui;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-weight: $weight-variable;
}
```

Comprehensive example of ordering items within a declaration block:

```scss
.class {
  @include size(10px);

  display: block;
  margin: $spacing-variable;

  @media (min-width: $screen-variable) {
    padding: $spacing-variable;
  }

  &:focus {
    border-color: $color-variable;
  }

  &::before {
    content: "";
  }

  .nested-element {
    margin: $spacing-variable;
  }
}
```

#### Motivation

Alphabetizing can be automated and is commonly a feature built into code editors
(see Resources below).

#### Linting

Alphabetical declaration ordering can be linted using stylelint with the
[stylelint-order] plugin and its `order/properties-alphabetical-order` rule.

#### Resources

- Atom users can use the [Sort Lines package], which provides commands and
  keybindings for alphabetical sorting.
- Sublime Text users can use the `Edit > Sort Lines` menu item, or press
  <kbd>F5</kbd> to sort lines alphabetically.
