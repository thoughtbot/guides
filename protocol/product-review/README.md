Product Review
==============

Cut down cycle time and focus on the user
by getting a teammate to review your changes to the product
before you get a code review or deploy to staging.

For each change, choose one of four techniques:

* In-person
* Screencast
* Video chat and screenshare

If they are sitting next to you,
