## Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at thoughtbot to see them. We have
a lot of people across a lot of timezones, so we leave all PRs open for at
least a week to get feedback from everyone.

## Content

Decisions about which libraries to use should live in template projects such as
[Suspenders].
