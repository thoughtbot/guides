Relational Databases
--------------------

* [Index foreign keys].
* Constrain most columns as [`NOT NULL`].
* In a SQL view, only select columns you need (i.e., avoid `SELECT table.*`).
* Use an `ORDER BY` clause on queries where the results will be displayed to a
  user, as queries without one may return results in a changing, arbitrary
  order.
