# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get
  past the bug?)
- Agree Physical/Virtual Location ("Will we both be comfortable here?")
- Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? Text editor and other tools)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? [Ping pong]?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking ([Have a break, have a…])
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll
  feel weird, do it anyway)

## Remote Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and valued during remote meetings that happen over video conferencing software.

- **Time zones:** Consider time zones when scheduling meetings - is the meeting 
    time respectful of everyone's work schedule?
- **Be Courteous:** Be respectful of others on your team.
  - Mute yourself when not talking to minimize background noise.
  - Confirm that everyone on your team can hear and understand you clearly.
  - Consider calling in if you have an unreliable internet connection.
  - Be understanding of interruptions that may happen with remote work,
    e.g. children, pets, other people who might be sharing space with your teammate.
- **Video Optional:** Everyone has different privacy needs when it comes to video
  conferencing.
  - Don't require participants to turn their camera on.
  - Encourage the use of virtual backgrounds.
- **Documentation:** Share what was discussed after the meeting with your team.
  Documenting meetings is in line with the flexibility of remote work.
  - Record the meeting if possible.
  - If recording isn't possible, have a designated note taker and rotate the position.
- **Share the Plan:** Let everyone know ahead of time what they can expect. Create a
  calendar invite with links to the video call, dial-in information and a meeting agenda
  or note about what the meeting will cover.
- **Share the mic:** Make sure everyone who wants to has an opportunity to speak.
  - Be on the lookout for raised hands and folks who unmute their mics, they may 
    be trying to speak without interrupting.
  - Use the chat for questions and have someone monitor the chat to make sure
    all questions are addressed.
  - If you notice someone is being ignored or spoken over, speak up so they have
  the opportunity to share their thoughts.
  - Be mindful of those dialing in by phone, as they might not have access to certain
  software features (e.g. hand raising).
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
  already been said. Consider if your voice is dominating the conversation.
  - Write down all of your ideas before and/or during the meeting. At the end of the meeting, 
  speak on any ideas that have not already been brought up by others.
  - If you're speaking on something that has been brought up but overlooked, say that you're
  amplifying an under-represented idea and give the idea's originator credit.

## In-Person Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and respected during meetings in person. You can [download a double-sided printout] of
these guides to display in your meeting rooms.

- **Be kind:** Treat each other with respect.
- **Remote matters:** Listen for and solicit input from members joining in-person
  meetings remotely so their voice is heard.
  - Ensure the space is set up so everyone can see each others' faces.
  - Enunciate and speak loud enough so that members joining remotely can hear you clearly.
  - Consider time zones when scheduling your meeting.
- **Introduce everyone:** Don't assume everyone has met before. Introductions
  help break the ice and give an opportunity for voices to be heard.
- **Pay Attention:** Be present with others during a meeting, but also engage
  and communicate in the way you feel most comfortable.
- **Be respectful of others' schedules:** Try to start and end meetings on time.
- **Step up, step back:** After you speak, let others speak. If you are speaking
  often, make sure others have had a chance to say something.
- **Apply the Shine Theory:** Notice if someone is being cut off or ignored.
  Help shine the light back on that contributor by repeating their idea, giving
  clear support and credit to its source.
- **Give credit:** Acknowledge input from others and highlight contributors.
  Show encouragement and, if you agree with something, call it out. Ensure that
  even the quiet voices are heard and supported.
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
  already been said. If it has and has been ignored, clarify that you are
  amplifying an under-recognized idea.
- **One mic:** Let one person speak at a time, and let them complete their full
  thought before responding. Don't interrupt.
- **Clarify what you hear:** Use phrases like "What I heard you say was..." or
  "My feedback for that is..."
- **Speak as I:** Try to speak from the _I_ perspective. Don't speak for others.
- **Disagree:** You don't have to agree with everybody, but be aware of how you
  frame your feedback. Criticize the idea, not the person.
- **Everyone can participate:** Assuming someone doesn't want to participate can
  be exclusionary. Give people the opportunity to decline an invitation.
- **Speak up:** Follow up if team members treat others disrespectfully. If you
  don't feel comfortable addressing someone directly, speak with your manager or
  Chief People Officer.
