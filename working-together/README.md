# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get
  past the bug?)
- Agree Physical/Virtual Location ("Will we both be comfortable here?")
- Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? Text editor and other tools)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? [Ping pong]?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking ([Have a break, have a…])
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll
  feel weird, do it anyway)

## Remote Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and valued during remote meetings that happen over video conferencing software.

- **Time zones:** Consider time zones when scheduling meetings - is the meeting 
    time respectful of everyone's work schedule?
- **Be Courteous:** Be respectful of others on your team.
  - Mute yourself when not talking to minimize background noise.
  - Confirm that everyone on your team can hear and understand you clearly.
  - Consider calling in if you have an unreliable internet connection.
  - Be understanding of interruptions that may happen with remote work,
    e.g. children, pets, other people who might be sharing space with your teammate.
- **Video Optional:** Everyone has different privacy needs when it comes to video
  conferencing.
  - Don't require participants to turn their camera on.
  - Encourage the use of virtual backgrounds.
- **Documentation:** Share what was discussed after the meeting with your team.
  Documenting meetings is in line with the flexibility of remote work.
  - Record the meeting if possible.
  - If recording isn't possible, have a designated note taker and rotate the position.
- **Share the Plan:** Let everyone know ahead of time what they can expect. Create a
  calendar invite with links to the video call, dial-in information and a meeting agenda
  or note about what the meeting will cover.
- **Share the mic:** Make sure everyone who wants to has an opportunity to speak.
  - Be on the lookout for raised hands and folks who unmute their mics, they may 
    be trying to speak without interrupting.
  - Use the chat for questions and have someone monitor the chat to make sure
    all questions are addressed.
  - If you notice someone is being ignored or spoken over, speak up so they have
  the opportunity to share their thoughts.
  - Be mindful of those dialing in by phone, as they might not have access to certain
  software features (e.g. hand raising).
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
  already been said. Consider if your voice is dominating the conversation.
  - Write down all of your ideas before and/or during the meeting. At the end of the meeting, 
  speak on any ideas that have not already been brought up by others.
  - If you're speaking on something that has been brought up but overlooked, say that you're
  amplifying an under-represented idea and give the idea's originator credit.

## In-Person Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and respected during meetings in person. You can [download a double-sided printout] of
these guides to display in your meeting rooms.

- **Be kind:** Treat each other with respect.
- **Remote matters:** Listen for and solicit input from members joining in-person
  meetings remotely so their voice is heard.
  - Ensure the space is set up so everyone can see each others' faces.
  - Enunciate and speak loud enough so that members joining remotely can hear you clearly.
  - Consider time zones when scheduling your meeting.
- **Introduce everyone:** Don't assume everyone has met before. Introductions
  help break the ice and give an opportunity for voices to be heard.
- **Pay Attention:** Be present with others during a meeting, but also engage
  and communicate in the way you feel most comfortable.
- **Be respectful of others' schedules:** Try to start and end meetings on time.
- **Step up, step back:** After you speak, let others speak. If you are speaking
  often, make sure others have had a chance to say something.
- **Apply the Shine Theory:** Notice if someone is being cut off or ignored.
  Help shine the light back on that contributor by repeating their idea, giving
  clear support and credit to its source.
- **Give credit:** Acknowledge input from others and highlight contributors.
  Show encouragement and, if you agree with something, call it out. Ensure that
  even the quiet voices are heard and supported.
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
  already been said. If it has and has been ignored, clarify that you are
  amplifying an under-recognized idea.
- **One mic:** Let one person speak at a time, and let them complete their full
  thought before responding. Don't interrupt.
- **Clarify what you hear:** Use phrases like "What I heard you say was..." or
  "My feedback for that is..."
- **Speak as I:** Try to speak from the _I_ perspective. Don't speak for others.
- **Disagree:** You don't have to agree with everybody, but be aware of how you
  frame your feedback. Criticize the idea, not the person.
- **Everyone can participate:** Assuming someone doesn't want to participate can
  be exclusionary. Give people the opportunity to decline an invitation.
- **Speak up:** Follow up if team members treat others disrespectfully. If you
  don't feel comfortable addressing someone directly, speak with your manager or
  Chief People Officer.

## Pronoun guidelines

At thoughtbot, we strive to make everyone feel included and able to bring their entire self to work. One of the ways we do this is by providing space for people to feel comfortable sharing their pronouns. Pronouns are often shared during introductions and can also be added to your Slack profile, Hub profile, Zoom display name, email signature, etc.

An important aspect of making everyone comfortable is keeping in mind that sharing pronouns is ALWAYS optional. A person may have many reasons they don’t want to share pronouns. Gender identity is a complex and personal subject and not everyone is comfortable addressing it at work.

While we don’t require sharing pronouns, the widespread practice of sharing them can make people feel pressured to share their own. Here are some guidelines for reducing that pressure:

- Never ask someone directly what their pronouns are. If you’d like to create an opportunity to share, you can share your own, but leave it up to individuals to decide whether they want to share.
- When proposing round robin introductions, don’t include pronouns in the list of things you’re asking people to share. “Share your name, your role, and your favorite breakfast food” is more inclusive than “Share your name, your role, and your pronouns.” Individuals can choose whether or not to include their pronouns in their introductions.
- If you don’t know someone’s pronouns and they haven’t proactively shared them, don’t assume. Use their name or “they/them” if you need to.
- Sometimes people’s pronouns change. If a person introduces themself with pronouns that are different from what they used previously, there’s no need to comment on the change.
- When everyone in a meeting or group shares their pronouns every time, it can implicitly ‘out’ a person who is the only one not sharing their pronouns. If you’re comfortable, you can help by occasionally not sharing your pronouns, especially when the majority of the group is sharing theirs. This can normalize the idea that pronouns are optional and opting out doesn’t imply a specific identity.
- If you’re asked to share your pronouns and you’d rather not, you do not need to provide an explanation. A simple “I’m not sharing my pronouns today” or “I’m fine with you addressing me by my name.” is enough.
