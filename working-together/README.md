# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get
  past the bug?)
- Agree Physical/Virtual Location ("Will we both be comfortable here?")
- Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? Text editor and other tools)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking ([Have a break, have a…])
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll
  feel weird, do it anyway)

## Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included
and respected during meetings. You can [download a double-sided printout] of
these guides to display in your meeting rooms.

- **Be kind:** Treat each other with respect.
- **Remote matters:** Listen for and solicit input from remote members so their
  voice is heard.
  - Ensure the space is set up so everyone can see each others' faces.
  - Enunciate and speak loud enough so that remote members can hear you clearly.
- **Introduce everyone:** Don't assume everyone has met before. Introductions
  help break the ice and give an opportunity for voices to be heard.
- **Pay Attention:** Be present with others during a meeting, but also engage
  and communicate in the way you feel most comfortable.
- **Be respectful of others' schedules:** Try to start and end meetings on time.
- **Step up, step back:** After you speak, let others speak. If you are speaking
  often, make sure others have had a chance to say something.
- **Apply the Shine Theory:** Notice if someone is being cut off or ignored.
  Help shine the light back on that contributor by repeating their idea, giving
  clear support and credit to its source.
- **Give credit:** Acknowledge input from others and highlight contributors.
  Show encouragement and, if you agree with something, call it out. Ensure that
  even the quiet voices are heard and supported.
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
  already been said. If it has and has been ignored, clarify that you are
  amplifying an under-recognized idea.
- **One mic:** Let one person speak at a time, and let them complete their full
  thought before responding. Don't interrupt.
- **Clarify what you hear:** Use phrases like "What I heard you say was..." or
  "My feedback for that is..."
- **Speak as I:** Try to speak from the _I_ perspective. Don't speak for others.
- **Disagree:** You don't have to agree with everybody, but be aware of how you
  frame your feedback. Criticize the idea, not the person.
- **Everyone can participate:** Assuming someone doesn't want to participate can
  be exclusionary. Give people the opportunity to decline an invitation.
- **Speak up:** Follow up if team members treat others disrespectfully. If you
  don't feel comfortable addressing someone directly, speak with your manager or
  Chief People Officer.
