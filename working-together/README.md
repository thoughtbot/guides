# Working Together

A guide for working well together.

## Pair Programming

**Before:**

- Agree Scope (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get past the bug?)
- Agree Physical/Virtual Location ("Will we both be comfortable here?")
- Agree Working Environment (Two keyboards? Text editor and other tools)
- Agree Pairing Style (Time-based? Ping pong?)

**During:**

- Keep the chat going (Think aloud. Encourage/support)
- Keep switching (Follow the pairing style)
- Keep both involved ("Could we do this another way?")
- Keep breaking ([Have a break, have a…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fejBO1HZXVQ))
- Keep checking in ("Could we search for a guide separately?")

**After:**

- Ask for Feedback (What did we do well? What could we have done better? It’ll feel weird, do it anyway)
