## Meeting Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to help people feel included and respected during
meetings:

* **Be kind:** Treat each other with respect.
* **Remote matters:** Listen for and solicit input from remote members so
their voice is heard.
  * Ensure the space is set up so everyone can see each
others' faces.
  * Enunciate and speak loud enough so that remote members can hear you
clearly.
* **Introduce everyone:** Don't assume everyone has met before. Introductions
help break the ice and give an opportunity for voices to be heard.
* **Pay Attention:** Be present with others during a meeting, but also engage
and communicate in the way you feel most comfortable.
* **Be respectful of others' schedules:** Try to start and end meetings on time.
* **Step up, step back:** After you speak, let others speak. If you are
speaking often, make sure others have had a chance to say something.
* **Apply the Shine Theory:** Notice if someone is being cut off or ignored. Help
shine the light back on that contributor by repeating their idea, giving clear
support and credit to its source.
* **Give credit:** Acknowledge input from others and highlight contributors.
Show encouragement and, if you agree with something, call it out. Ensure that
even the quiet voices are heard and supported.
* **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not
already been said. If it has and has been ignored, clarify that you are
amplifying an under-recognized idea.
* **One mic:** Let one person speak at a time, and let them complete their full
thought before responding. Don't interrupt.
* **Clarify what you hear:** Use phrases like "What I heard you say was..." or
"My feedback for that is..."
* **Speak as I:** Try to speak from the *I* perspective. Don't speak for others.
* **Disagree:** You don't have to agree with everybody, but be aware of how you
frame your feedback. Criticize the idea, not the person.
* **Everyone can participate:** Assuming someone doesn't want to participate
can be exclusionary. Give people the opportunity to decline an invitation.
* **Speak up:** Follow up if team members treat others disrespectfully. If you
don't feel comfortable addressing someone directly, speak with your manager or Chief
People Officer.
