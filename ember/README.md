# Ember

- Avoid using `$` without scoping to `this.$` in views and components.
- Prefer to make model lookup calls in routes instead of controllers (`find`,
  `findAll`, etc.).
- Prefer adding properties to controllers instead of models.
- Don't use jQuery outside of views and components.
- Prefer to use predefined `Ember.computed.*` functions when possible.
- Use `href="#"` for links that have an action.
- Prefer dependency injection through `Ember.inject` over initializers, globals
  on window, or namespaces. ([sample](ember.js#L1-L11))
- Prefer sub-routes over maintaining state.
- Prefer explicit setting of boolean properties over `toggleProperty`.
- Prefer testing your application with [QUnit].

## Testing

- Prefer `findWithAssert` over `find` when fetching an element you expect to
  exist
