# Android

- Properties of views should be alphabetized, with the exception of `id`,
  `layout_width`, and `layout_height` which should be placed first in that
  order.
- Use Kotlin for all new code.
- Prefer pull request reviews from other Android developers but be open to
  reviews from iOS and React Native developers as well.
- Prefer non-null types.
- Use string resources for all user-visible text.
- Prefer vector drawables over PNGs or JPEGs.
- Prefer Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) for your app architecture.
