# Object-Oriented Design

- Avoid global variables.
- Avoid long parameter lists.
- Limit dependencies of an object (entities an object depends on).
- Limit an object's dependents (entities that depend on an object).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
- Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too
  many things.
- [Tell, don't ask].
