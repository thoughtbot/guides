## Tools

- **[GraphiQL].** An Electron-based "web IDE" for interacting with GraphQL APIs.
  GraphiQL can also be served as a page in an application.
- **[GraphQL Playground]** An Electron-based "web IDE" for interacting with
  GraphQL APIs. Intends to expand upon GraphiQL.
- **[Insomnia]** An HTTP client with solid GraphQL support.
- **[Apollo Client Dev Tools]** Chrome Extension offering developer tools for
  Apollo projects.

## Best Practices

- Follow the latest version of the [GraphQL specification].
- When serving over HTTP, respond with a 200 OK status code to all GraphQL
  queries.
- If a client or server error occurs, use the `errors` key in the GraphQL
  response.
- If a user-facing error occurs (such as invalid user input), use the `data` key
  in the GraphQL response.
- If a mutation can fail because of a user error, use a union type to describe
  the possible outcomes.
- If there is an authenticated user, provide the user in the context for the
  resolver.
- Provide the updated object as a field in mutations.
- Provide the ID of the deleted object as a field in mutations that delete
  objects.
- Use JSON as a default transport format.
