为了把事情做好

Set up laptop
-------------

Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store.

Set up your laptop with [this script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)
and [these dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

Create Rails app
----------------

Get Suspenders.

    gem install suspenders

Create the app.

    suspenders app --heroku true --github organization/app

Create iOS app
--------------

Create a new project in Xcode with these settings:

* Check 'Create local git repository for this project'.
* Check 'Use Automatic Reference Counting'.
* Set an appropriate 2 or 3 letter class prefix.
* Set the Base SDK to 'Latest iOS'.
* Set the iOS Deployment Target to 6.0.
* Use the Apple LLVM compiler.

Get liftoff.

    gem install liftoff

Run liftoff in the project directory.

    liftoff

Set up Rails app
----------------

Get the code.

    git clone git@github.com:organization/app.git

Set up the app's dependencies.

    cd project
    ./bin/setup

Use [Heroku config](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config) to get `ENV`
variables.

    heroku config:pull --remote staging

Delete extra lines in `.env`, leaving only those needed for app to function
properly. For example: `BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID` and `S3_SECRET`.

Use [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run the app locally.

    foreman start

It uses your `.env` file and `Procfile` to run processes just like Heroku's
[Cedar](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar/) stack.

Maintain a Rails app
--------------------

* Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your
  development machine or process.
* Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.
* Perform work in a feature branch.
* Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes.
* Use a [pull request] for code reviews.

[pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

Write a feature
---------------

Create a local feature branch based off master.

    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout -b <branch-name>

Prefix the branch name with your initials.

Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes.

    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/master

Resolve conflicts. When feature is complete and tests pass, stage the changes.

    rake
    git add --all

When you've staged the changes, commit them.

    git status
    git commit --verbose

Write a [good commit message]. Example format:

    Present-tense summary under 50 characters

    * More information about commit (under 72 characters).
    * More information about commit (under 72 characters).

    http:://project.management-system.com/ticket/123

Share your branch.

    git push origin <branch-name>

Submit a [GitHub pull request].

Ask for a code review in [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/).

[good commit message]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
[GitHub pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

Review code
-----------

A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow
[Code Review](../code-review) guidelines to avoid
miscommunication.

They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the Github
web interface or in Campfire.

For changes which they can make themselves, they check out the branch.

    git checkout <branch-name>
    rake db:migrate
    rake
    git diff staging/master..HEAD

They make small changes right in the branch, test the feature in browser,
run tests, commit, and push.

When satisfied, they comment on the pull request `Ready to merge.`

Merge
-----

Rebase interactively. Squash commits like "Fix whitespace" into one or a
small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages to reveal intent.

    git fetch origin
    git rebase -i origin/master
    rake

View a list of new commits. View changed files. Merge branch into master.

    git log origin/master..<branch-name>
    git diff --stat origin/master
    git checkout master
    git merge <branch-name> --ff-only
    git push

Delete your remote feature branch.

    git push origin --delete <branch-name>

Delete your local feature branch.

    git branch --delete <branch-name>

Deploy
------

View a list of new commits. View changed files. Deploy to
[Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) staging.

    git fetch staging
    git log staging/master..master
    git diff --stat staging/master
    git push staging

If necessary, run migrations and restart the dynos.

    heroku run rake db:migrate --remote staging
    heroku restart --remote staging

[Introspect] to make sure everything's ok.

    watch heroku ps --remote staging

Test the feature in browser.

Deploy to production.

    git fetch production
    git log production/master..master
    git diff --stat production/master
    git push production
    heroku run rake db:migrate --remote production
    heroku restart --remote production
    watch heroku ps --remote production

Watch logs and metrics dashboards.

Close pull request and comment `Merged.`

Set Up Production Environment
-----------------------------

* Make sure that your [`Procfile`] is set up to run Unicorn.
* Make sure the PG Backups add-on is enabled.
* Create a read-only [Heroku Follower] for your production database. If a Heroku
  database outage occurs, Heroku can use the follower to get your app back up
  and running faster.
