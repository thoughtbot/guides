# Testing with Jest

- Use [eslint-plugin-jest] to enforce testing style
- Use [testing-library/jest-dom] and [jest-community/jest-extended] for
  supplemental expectation matchers
- Use [React Testing Library] for testing [React](/react/) components
- Use [React Hooks Testing Library] for testing [React Hooks]
- Use [User Event] for simulating DOM events on React components under test
- Use [Fishery] for building factories
- Prefer placing test suite files alongside source files (e.g. `Thing.tsx` /
  `Thing.test.tsx`)
- Prefer writing specific unit tests over [Snapshot Testing]
- Prefer `describe` and `it` blocks over `test` blocks
- Prefer [.resolves/.rejects] over awaiting promises in tests
